Â§4Problems:
You can make infinite power by removing some bits of the contraption, you can if you want, but if you wanna play the fun and not cheaty way, use the power system correctly
Â§1Power System:
A normal power source creates 4 blocks of power with 16 RPM
A powerful power source creates 1 block of power with 64 RPM - NOT ADDED YET
